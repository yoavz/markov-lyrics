I am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together 
See how they run like pigs from a gun, see how they fly 
I'm crying 

Sitting on a cornflake, waiting for the van to come 
Corporation teashirt stupid bloody Tuesday 
Man you been a naughty boy, you let your face grow long 

I am the eggman oh 
They are the eggmen oh 
I am the walrus 
Goo goo g'joob 

Mr. City policeman sitting pretty little policeman in a row 
See how they fly like Lucy in the sky, see how they run 
I'm crying, I'm crying, I'm crying, I'm crying 

Yellow matter custard dripping from a dead dog's eye 
Crabalocker fishwife pornographic priestess 
Boy you been a naughty girl, you let your knickers down 

I am the eggman oh 
They are the eggmen oh 
I am the walrus 
Goo goo g'joob 

Sitting in an English garden waiting for the sun 
If the sun don't come you get a tan from standing in the English rain 

I am the eggman 
They are the eggmen 
I am the walrus 
Goo goo g'joob g'goo goo g'joob 

Expert texpert choking smokers 
Don't you think the joker laughs at you (ha ha ha) 
See how they smile like pigs in a sty, see how they snied 
I'm crying
