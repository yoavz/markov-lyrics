Up on melancholy hill
There's a plastic tree
Are you here with me?
Just looking out on the day of another dream

Well, you can't get what you want
But you can get me
So let's set up and see, love
'Cause you are my medicine
When you're close to me
When you're close to me

So call in the submarines
'round the world we'll go
Does anybody know her?
If we're looking out on the day of another dream

If you can't get what you want
Then you come with me

Up on melancholy hill
Sits a manatee
Just looking out for the day
When you're close to me
When you're close to me

When you're close to me
